Role: Data Analyst | Duration: Janâ€“Jun 2024

Goodcabs is a fast-growing cab service expanding across Indiaâ€™s tier-2 cities. In this project, I analyzed six months of operational data to uncover actionable insights on trip volumes, passenger satisfaction, and revenue trends to help Goodcabs achieve its ambitious growth targets.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
MySQL: Data extraction, cleaning, and query optimization.

Power BI: Built an interactive dashboard with key metrics and trends.

PowerPoint: Created a presentation to communicate insights and recommendations.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights
City Performance: Jaipur tops in trip volumes but needs better pricing; Surat has strong repeat riders but underpriced fares.

Demand Patterns: Weekdays see higher demand in business cities; weekends and Febâ€“May are peak for tourist hubs.

Passenger Loyalty: New passengers give higher ratings than repeat customers, highlighting a service gap.

Revenue Trends: Seasonal and local events significantly impact trip demand and revenue spikes.

âœ… Recommendations
Run city-specific marketing to boost trips in low-performing areas.
