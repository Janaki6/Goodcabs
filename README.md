Goodcabs Performance Analysis: Driving Success in Tier-2 Cities 🚖

Goodcabs, a growing cab service in India, has been operating in tier-2 cities for two years but is aiming to improve market penetration and performance. 

Through the Codebasics Resume Challenge #13, I had the opportunity to dive deep into their operational data and provide insights into key metrics like trip volume, passenger satisfaction, and revenue trends.
This project allowed me to blend technical skills with business strategy to uncover actionable insights and drive growth!

Tools Used:

MySQL: For data extraction and query optimization.
Power BI: To visualize key metrics and create interactive dashboards.
PowerPoint: For presenting insights and recommendations.

Key Insights:

City Performance: Jaipur leads in trip volume but struggles with overpriced fares. Surat excels in repeat passengers but requires better pricing strategies.
Peak Demand: Weekdays dominate in business cities, while weekends are preferred in tourist destinations.
Seasonal Trends: Tourist cities show high demand during February-May, while business hubs have consistent demand from May-June.
Loyalty Metrics: New passengers tend to rate services higher than repeat customers.
Revenue Patterns: Revenue peaks during February-May in tourism cities, driven by seasonal demand.
Passenger Satisfaction: Tourism cities excel in ratings and trip target, but face challenges in achieving new passenger targets.
External Influences: Weather and local events significantly impact trip demand.

Recommendations:
Focus on increasing trip volumes through targeted campaigns and marketing strategies in underperforming cities.
Implement dynamic pricing to balance profitability and customer satisfaction.
Implement demand-based driver allocation to meet varying city dynamics.
Introduce Electric Vehicles (EVs) for cost efficiency and environmental sustainability.
Optimize pricing strategies for high- and low-revenue cities.
Partner with malls, hotels, and event venues to drive demand and enhance visibility.
Implement Customer Feedback to improve service quality.
