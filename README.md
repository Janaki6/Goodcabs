Duration: Analyzed Jan‚ÄìJun 2024 data
Role: Data Analyst ‚Äî Strategy & Insights

Goodcabs, a rapidly growing cab service focused on India‚Äôs tier-2 cities, aims to expand its market share and improve operational efficiency. Through this project, I analyzed six months of operational data to identify patterns, uncover growth opportunities, and recommend actionable strategies.

üîç Tools Used:

MySQL: Data extraction, cleansing, and complex query optimization.

Power BI: Interactive dashboards showcasing key metrics and trends.

PowerPoint: For stakeholder-ready presentations and strategic recommendations.

üìà Key Findings:

Top Cities: Jaipur leads in trip volumes but struggles with fare pricing, while Surat has strong repeat passenger loyalty but underpriced fares.

Peak Demand: Business hubs are busiest on weekdays; tourist cities peak on weekends and during Feb‚ÄìMay.

Passenger Insights: New customers rate services higher than repeat riders ‚Äî highlighting a loyalty gap.

Revenue Trends: Seasonal spikes align with local tourism calendars and events.

External Drivers: Local events and weather patterns significantly shape trip demand.

‚úÖ Strategic Recommendations:

Launch city-specific marketing campaigns to boost trips in low-performing regions.

Implement dynamic pricing to balance customer affordability with profitability.

Invest in Electric Vehicles (EVs) for long-term cost savings and sustainability goals.

Forge partnerships with malls, hotels, and event venues to expand market reach.

Continuously capture and act on passenger feedback to lift satisfaction and loyalty.
